This file layout was inspired heavily by LazyVim (https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/tree/main/lua/lazyvim/plugins) because I wouldn't know what to do on my own.

One thing I don't like is that the categories feel somewhat arbitrary - I feel some plugins could easily fall into multiple files. Also, the number of different files I separate plugins into seems arbitrary.
